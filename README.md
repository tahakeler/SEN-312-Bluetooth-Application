# SEN-312 Bluetooth Scanner Application
Author: Taha KELER
Course: SEN-312:00040 â€“ App Development
Platform: Flutter (iOS only, tested on physical device)

---

## Project Description
This is a basic mobile app built with Flutter that scans for nearby Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. It fulfills the assignment requirement of scanning, listing, and running a mobile application on either simulator or real device. Since Bluetooth scanning does not work in simulators, this project is designed to run on a physical iPhone.

## Features
- Start BLE scan with a single button
- Show device name and identifier for each result
- Built using flutter_blue_plus package
- iOS support only (scanner requires real hardware)

---

## Technologies
Flutter version: 3.29.3
Plugin: flutter_blue_plus
Tooling: Dart SDK, Xcode 16.2, CocoaPods
Tested on: iPhone device with iOS 17+
